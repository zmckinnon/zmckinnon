# My README

I read [a great article](https://medium.com/better-programming/personal-user-manuals-the-good-the-bad-and-the-template-7b80db5044ea) recently about personal user guides/READMEs and I thought I'd give it a try.

## About Me

I am from Alabama where I recieved a Bachelor of Software Engineering from Auburn University. Outside of work, I play as much basketball as I can and I enjoy spending time with my wife and two boys. I have recently been trying to improve my React skills.

## How to Contact Me

For quick questions, hit me up on Slack and I will likely get back to you ASAP. If a longer discussion is warranted, put something on my calendar and I prefer a video conference or to grab a coffee or go for a walk.

## Preferred Working Style

I prefer lots of collaboration. Usually this means 1on1s, team meetings and pairing. I usually only need a quiet environment when I am writing.  I use my calendar to keep things balanced, if it isn't on my calendar, I might miss it.

I try not to push my preconceived notions of what "works" on people. Different situations call for different solutions. This is the essence of engineering.

If you are afraid to ask tough questions or say unpopular opinions, then you aren't doing what is best. I am committed to creating an environment where everyone is comfortable speaking their mind.

## What Motivates Me

I want to improve everything around me. I am a perfectionist, but I realize that perfection is impossible so I try to improve everyday. It is important for me to understand the big picture so that I know the direction I should be going.

## What Demotivates Me

Doing things for the sake of doing things is a waste of time. Everything should have a purpose.

## My Values (and what I value in others)

**Intentionality** - I admire people who prioritize things and find that they tend to be more successful.

**Understanding** - Seeking first to understand is a critical piece of my successs.

**Team Work** - This is how you make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.

## My Blind Spots

I tend to get defensive when I feel like me or my team is attacked. This happens because I am extremely passionate about my team and it is my nature to fight for what I believe.

## My Pet Peeves

People who put themselves above the team.

## Other

I value feedback so feel free to solicit or give feedback from me whenever.

This README is a work in progress and I will continue to updated it as I learn new things.
