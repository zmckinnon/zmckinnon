## About Me

I am from Alabama where I recieved a Bachelors in Software Engineering from Auburn University. Outside of work, I play as much basketball as I can and I enjoy spending time with my wife and two boys. I have recently been trying to learn React.

## How to Contact Me

For quick questions, hit me up on Slack and I can probably get back to you. If a longer discussion is warranted, put something on my calendar and I prefer a video conference or to grab a coffee.

I try to stay connected as much as possible so I will likely see your message or invite ASAP. Even if I don't act on it immediately.
